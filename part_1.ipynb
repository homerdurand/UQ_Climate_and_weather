    "\n",
    "The Lorenz 96 model is a simplified dynamical system used to represent the atmosphere and study chaos in weather and climate dynamics. It consists of a set of coupled variables that evolve over time, with each variable representing different aspects of the system (e.g., temperature or pressure). The model is widely used to investigate stochastic parametrizations and the effects of different levels of resolution in weather and climate models.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Lorenz 96 model defines two types of variables:\n",
    "- **Slow Variables $X_k$**: These are large-amplitude, slow-changing variables, which represent the 'resolved' components of the system.\n",
    "- **Fast Variables $Y_j$**: These are small-amplitude, fast-changing variables, representing the 'unresolved' components."

    "The [Great Storm of 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_storm_of_1987) hit southeastern Britain unexpectedly, causing widespread damage. Though there were some early warnings, the storm was not predicted for the night it struck, catching people by surprise. Winds reached up to **220 km/h**, wreaking havoc across southern England. Thousands of trees were uprooted, and parks, estates, and landmarks were severely damaged. Transportation was crippled as roads, railways, and airports were closed, while widespread power outages plunged much of the southeast, including London, into darkness. The storm resulted in **18 fatalities** and left many homes and schools in ruins. It also caused **£2 billion in damage**, making it the second most costly weather event in UK history. Though the storm’s timing at night helped reduce casualties, it highlighted the significant challenges of weather forecasting."

    "In the early 1990s, following the unexpected storm of 1987, weather forecasting began shifting from simple deterministic predictions to **probabilistic ensemble forecasting**. This approach runs multiple simulations with slightly different initial conditions, providing a range of possible outcomes rather than a single forecast. Advances in computing power and parallel processing made this transition possible, allowing meteorologists to better account for uncertainties in atmospheric conditions. Ensemble forecasting has since become a key tool in operational weather prediction, improving the ability to anticipate extreme events and their likelihood.\n",
